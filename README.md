# dp_inference

This directory contains code for performing differential privacy inference using the dp_inference package.

## Installation

To set up and install the `dp_inference` conda environment, follow these steps:

1. Create the conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:

    ```shell
    conda env create -f environment.yml

2. Activate the `dp_inference` environment:

    ```shell
    conda activate dp_inference
    ```

    You are now ready to use the `dp_inference` package for differential privacy inference.

3. Next, use the following command to the dp_inference package locally:
    
    ```shell
    pip install -e .
